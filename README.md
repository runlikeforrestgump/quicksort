# quicksort #

Quicksort sorts and partitions a list recursively, which is the opposite of what merge sort does (merge sort partitions a list and then sorts). A pivot (i.e., a randomly selected value from the list) is used to control sorting and partitioning: all other values in the list are compared against the pivot. Each partition selects its own pivot. The list is sorted so that all the values to the left of the pivot or less than or equal to it, and all the values to the right of the pivot or greater than or equal to it.

As an exercise, I implemented the quicksort algorithm in the following programming languages:
* C;
* Java;
* Lisp (MIT Scheme);
* Python;
* Ruby;
* and x86 Assembly (GAS syntax).
